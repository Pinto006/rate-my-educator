## General Information

Our app provides a place for students to review, rate and research their teachers and principals.  Many students like to prepare for their upcoming year by getting a feel for the teacher they are about to have for the upcoming term.  Students and parents may also be trying to decide which school they would like to attend and would like to see reviews on the teachers and principals of that school to make a more informed decision. This app was built using REACT, MongoDB and Mongoose ODM. Our app is deployed on Heroku and is responsive so users can use it on the go.
